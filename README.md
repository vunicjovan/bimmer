2. Execute the `setup.ps1` script, which install Scoop, Just and recommended Visual Studio Code extensions.
3. Open Visual Studio Code and go to user settings (JSON) with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (type in: `Open User Settings (JSON)`)
4. Append the content of `vscode-settings.json` file into your existing Visual Studio Code JSON settings file.
5. Install the required dependencies for both front- and back-end services by executing the following command: `just setup`
6. Run the app (client + server) via the `just run` command
7. Go to the Bimmer UI by opening `http://localhost:5173/`
